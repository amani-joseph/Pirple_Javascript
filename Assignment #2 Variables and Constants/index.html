               What's your favorite song? Think of all the attributes that you could use to describe that song. That is: all of
               it's details or "meta-data". These are attributes like "Artist", "Year Released", "Genre", "Duration", etc. Think of as
               many different characteristics as you can.
          </p>
          <p>
               In your text editor, create an empty file and name it song.js
               
              
          </p>
          <p>
               Now, within that file, list all of the attributes of the song, one after another, by creating variables for each
               attribute, and giving each variable a value. Here's an example:
          </p>
     </section>
     <style>
          section{
               margin: 5rem;
               width: auto;
               height: auto;
               padding: 0px;
               display: flex;
               flex-direction: column;
               
          }
          p{
               font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
               font-size: medium;
               max-width: 40rem;
               


          }
     </style>
     <script src="songs.js"></script>
</body>
